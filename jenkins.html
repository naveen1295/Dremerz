            Jenkins
        </h1>
        <p>Jenkins is a software that allows <b>continuous integration</b>. Jenkins will be installed on a server where
            the central build will take place. The following flowchart demonstrates a very simple workflow of how
            Jenkins works.</p>
        <img src="images/why_jenkins.jpg" alt="Why Jenkins" />
        <p>Continuous Integration is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared
            repository at regular intervals. This concept was meant to remove the problem of finding later occurrence of
            issues in the build lifecycle. Continuous integration requires the developers to have frequent builds. The
            common practice is that whenever a code commit occurs, a build should be triggered.</p>

                <td>No minimum requirement. Note that since all builds will be stored on the Jenkins machines, it has to
                    be ensured that sufficient disk space is available for build storage.</td>

        <p>The official website for Jenkins is <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow"

            the Jenkins official website</p>

        <h2>Starting Jenkins</h2>
        <p>Open the command prompt. From the command prompt, browse to the directory where the jenkins.war file is
            present. Run the following command</p>
        <pre>
            D:\&gt;Java –jar Jenkins.war
        </pre>
        <p>After the command is run, various tasks will run, one of which is the extraction of the war file which is
            done by an embedded webserver called winstone.</p>
        <pre>
            Java –jar Jenkins.war
            INFO: Beginning extraction from war file
        </pre>
        <p>Once the processing is complete without major errors, the following line will come in the output of the
            command prompt.</p>
        <pre>
            INFO: Jenkins is fully up and running
        </pre>
        <h2>Accessing Jenkins</h2>
        <p>Once Jenkins is up and running, one can access Jenkins from the link &minus; <b>http://localhost:8080</b></p>
        <p>This link will bring up the Jenkins dashboard.</p>
