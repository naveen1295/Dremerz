        Web Services
    </h2>
    <p>
        A web service is any piece of software that makes itself available over the internet and uses a standardized XML
        messaging system. XML is used to encode all communications to a web service. For example, a client invokes a web
        service by sending an XML message, then waits for a corresponding XML response. As all communication is in XML,
        web services are not tied to any one operating system or programming language—Java can talk with Perl; Windows
        applications can talk with Unix applications.

        Web services are self-contained, modular, distributed, dynamic applications that can be described, published,
        located, or invoked over the network to create products, processes, and supply chains. These applications can be
        local, distributed, or web-based. Web services are built on top of open standards such as TCP/IP, HTTP, Java,
        HTML, and XML.

        Web services are XML-based information exchange systems that use the Internet for direct
        application-to-application interaction. These systems can include programs, objects, messages, or documents.

        A web service is a collection of open protocols and standards used for exchanging data between applications or
        systems. Software applications written in various programming languages and running on various platforms can use
        web services to exchange data over computer networks like the Internet in a manner similar to inter-process
        communication on a single computer. This interoperability (e.g., between Java and Python, or Windows and Linux
        applications) is due to the use of open standards.

        To summarize, a complete web service is, therefore, any service that −

        Is available over the Internet or private (intranet) networks

        Uses a standardized XML messaging system

        Is not tied to any one operating system or programming language

        Is self-describing via a common XML grammar

        Is discoverable via a simple find mechanism
