        Web Services
    </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                The term Web services describes a standardized way of integrating Web-based applications using the XML,
                SOAP, WSDL and UDDI open standards over an Internet protocol backbone.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                XML is used to tag the data, SOAP is used to transfer the data, WSDL is used for describing the
                services available and UDDI is used for listing what services are available.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                These applications can be local, distributed, or web-based. Web services are built on top of open
                standards such as TCP/IP, HTTP, Java, HTML, and XML.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Software applications written in various programming languages and running on various platforms can use
                web services to exchange data over computer networks like the Internet. <br>
                This interoperability (e.g.,
                between Java and Python, or Windows and Linux applications) is due to the use of open standards.

    <h3>
        Web Service Components
    </h3>
    <p>
        There are three major web service components
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong> SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol </strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    XML bases protocol for accessing web services
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    platform independent and language independent
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li> <strong>WSDL - Web Services Description Language</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    WSDL is a xml document containing information about web services such as method name, method
                    parameter and how to access it
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    WSDL is a part of UDDI. It acts as a interface between web service applications
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li> <strong>UDDI - Universal Description, Discovery and Integration</strong> </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    UDDI is a directory of web service interfaces described by WSDL, containing information about web
                    services.

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3> <strong>SOAP</strong> </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        SOAP defines a standard communication protocol (set of rules) specification for XML-based
                        message exchange. SOAP uses different transport protocols, such as HTTP and SMTP.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The Standard protocol HTTP makes it easier for SOAP model to tunnel across firewalls and proxies
                        without any modifications to the SOAP protocol.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        WS Security: SOAP defines its own security known as WS Security.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Language and Platform independent: SOAP web services can be written in any programming language
                        and executed in any platform.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Slow: SOAP uses XML format that must be parsed to be read. It defines many standards that must
                        be followed while developing the SOAP applications. So it is slow and consumes more bandwidth
                        and resource.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        WSDL dependent: SOAP uses WSDL and doesn't have any other mechanism to discover the service.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>REST</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>REST is an architectural style not a protocol.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        REST describes a set of architectural principles by which data can be transmitted over a
                        standardized interface (such as HTTP).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Fast: RESTful Web Services are fast because there is no strict specification like SOAP. It
                        consumes less bandwidth and resource.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Language and Platform independent: RESTful web services can be written in any programming
                        language and executed in any platform.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Can use SOAP: RESTful web services can use SOAP web services as the implementation.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Permits different data format: RESTful web service permits different data format such as Plain
                        Text, HTML, XML and JSON.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        A client can access the resource using the unique URI and a representation of the resource is
                        returned. With each new resource representation, the client is said to transfer state. While
                        accessing RESTful resources with HTTP protocol, the URL of the resource serves as the resource
                        identifier and GET, PUT, DELETE, POST and HEAD are the standard HTTP operations to be performed
                        on that resource.
                    </p>
                </li>

    <h2>Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)</h2>
    <p>Service Oriented Architecture or SOA is a design pattern. It is designed to provide services to other
        applications through protocol. It is a concept only and not tied to any programming language or platform.</p>
    <p>Web services is a technology of SOA most likely.</p>
    <h3>Service</h3>
    <p>A service is well-defined, self-contained function that represents unit of functionality. A service can exchange
        information from another service. It is not dependent on the state of another service.</p>
    <h3>Service Connections</h3>
    <p>The figure given below illustrates the service oriented architecture. Service consumer sends service request to
        the service provider and service provider sends the service response to the service consumer. The service
        connection is understandable to both service consumer and service provider.</p>

    <h1>Java Web Services Tutorial</h1>
    <p> The java web service application can be accessed by other programming languages such as .Net
        and PHP.</p>
    <p>Java web service application perform communication through WSDL (Web Services Description Language). There are
        two ways to write java web service application code: SOAP and RESTful.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Java Web Services API</h2>
    <p>There are two main API's defined by Java for developing web service applications since JavaEE 6.</p>
    <p>1) <strong>JAX-WS</strong>: for SOAP web services. The are two ways to write JAX-WS application code: by RPC
        style and Document style.</p>
    <p>2) <strong>JAX-RS</strong>: for RESTful web services. There are mainly 2 implementation currently in use for
        creating JAX-RS application: Jersey and RESTeasy.</p>

    <h1><strong>HTTP Methods</strong></h1>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#get"><code>GET</code></a>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        GET method is used to retreive data from a server at the specified resource</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><a href="#post"><code>POST</code></a>
            <ul>
                <p>POST requests are used to send data to the API sever to create or udpate a resource.
                    The data sent to the server is stored in the request body of the HTTP request.</p>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><a href="#put"><code>PUT</code></a>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Simlar to POST, PUT requests are used to send data to the API to create or update a resource. The
                        difference is that PUT requests are idempotent. That is, calling the same PUT request multiple
                        times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly make
                        have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><a href="#head"><code>HEAD</code></a>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The HEAD method is almost identical to GET, except without the response body. In other words, if
                        GET /users returns a list of users, then HEAD /users will make the same request but won't get
                        back the list of users.

                        HEAD requests are useful for checking what a GET request will return before actually making a
                        GET request -- like before downloading a large file or response body. Learn more about HEAD
                        requests on MDN.

                        It's worth pointing out that not every endpoint that supports GET will support HEAD - it
                        completely depends on the API you're testing.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><a href="#delete"><code>DELETE</code></a>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The DELETE method is exactly as it sounds: delete the resource at the specified URL. This method
                        is one of the more common in RESTful APIs so it's good to know how it works.

                        If a new user is created with a POST request to /users, and it can be retrieved with a GET
                        request to /users/{{userid}}, then making a DELETE request to /users/{{userid}} will completely
                        remove that user.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><a href="#patch"><code>PATCH</code></a>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>A PATCH request is one of the lesser-known HTTP methods, but I'm including it this high in the
                        list since it is similar to POST and PUT. The difference with PATCH is that you only apply
                        partial modifications to the resource.

                        The difference between PATCH and PUT, is that a PATCH request is non-idempotent (like a POST
                        request).

                        To expand on partial modification, say you're API has a /users/{{userid}} endpoint, and a user
                        has a username. With a PATCH request, you may only need to send the updated username in the
                        request body - as opposed to POST and PUT which require the full user entity.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><a href="#options"><code>OPTIONS</code></a>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Last but not least we have OPTIONS requests. OPTIONS requests are one of my favorites, though not
                        as widely used as the other HTTP methods. In a nutshell, an OPTIONS request should return data
                        describing what other methods and operations the server supports at the given URL.

                        OPTIONS requests are more loosely defined and used than the others, making them a good candidate
                        to test for fatal API errors. If an API isn't expecting an OPTIONS request, it's good to put a
                        test case in place that verifies failing behavior.</p>

    <p>Here are important points to be considered:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>GET operations are read only and are safe.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>PUT and DELETE operations are idempotent means their result will always same no matter how many times
                these operations are invoked.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>PUT and POST operation are nearly same with the difference lying only in the result where PUT operation
                is idempotent and POST operation can cause different result.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
