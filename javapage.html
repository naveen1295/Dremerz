    Core JAVA
  </h1>
  <p>
    Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along
    with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as
    weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.


    <ul>
      <li>
        Class - <br> A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects. Class attributes are
        variables within a class. We can access attributes by creating an object of the class, and by using the dot
        syntax (.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Object - <br> an object is created from a class. We have already created the class named MyClass, so now we can
        use this to create objects. We can create multiple objects of one class.

        To create an object of MyClass, specify the class name, followed by the object name, and use the keyword new:
        <br>
        ClassName myObj = new ClassName();
      </li>
      <li>
        Method - <br> A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called. We can pass data, known as
        parameters, into a method. Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions. A
        method must be declared within a class. It is defined with the name of the method, followed by parantheses ().
        Java provides some pre-defined methods, such as System.out.println(), but we can also create our own methods
        to perform certain actions
      </li>
      <li>
        Compile and running java file from cmd
        <br>
        javac filename.java --- <em>compiling the java file which creates a .class file</em>
        <br>
        java filename --- <em>running the class file created by compiling the java file</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        public static void main (){} - this is the main function from which the execution starts
      </li>
      <li>
        DataTypes <br>
        <p>
          Data types are divided into two groups:
          Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
          Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes (you will learn more about these in a later
          chapter)

          int 4 bytes Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483.648 to 2,147,483,647 <br>
          long 8 bytes Stores whole numbers from -9,223.372,036.854,775.808 to 9,223.372,036,854,775,808 <br>
          float 4 bytes Stores fractional numbers from 3.4e−038 to 3.4e+038. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal
          digits <br>
          double 8 bytes Stores fractional numbers from 1.7e−308 to 1.7e+038. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits

          boolean 1 byte Stores true or false values <br>
          char 2 bytes Stores a single character/letter <br>
